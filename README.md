# MobileAppChallenge

//Overview

Our Application would be to better assist the Students First Center here at UC Merced.
As an employee here at the SFC, I see the everyday stuggles of the students here at UCM. 
So, why not tackle these problems head on and also develop a way to give back to the bigger 
campus community. Our app would not only be assisting those who currently go to UCM but would 
also help students curious about the campus or universities in general.
